## 🔮 About The Project

In a world of constant notifications and pressure, Aether Well is a space for quiet reflection. It's a digital wishing well built on a simple premise: you are given a few coins each day. You can spend one to record a wish, a hope, or a goal, which is then cast into the well for you to reflect on later.

This project was built in under 48 hours for the **HackClub Siege**, Week 1.

### 🪙 Theme: Coins

The app is built around a simple, mindful economy:
*   **Earning:** Users are rewarded with a small number of coins for visiting the app each day, encouraging a brief, daily moment of reflection.
*   **Spending:** Each wish costs one coin, making the act of wishing an intentional and valuable choice.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Daily Coin Allotment:** Receive 5 free coins every 24 hours.
*   **Make a Wish:** Spend a coin to add a wish to your personal, persistent well.
*   **Persistent Storage:** All wishes and your coin balance are saved directly in your browser via `localStorage`.
*   **Minimalist & Calming UI:** Designed to be a beautiful, non-intrusive experience.

## 🛠️ Built With

*   **SvelteKit:** The core application framework.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For fast and beautiful utility-first styling.
*   **Vite:** The lightning-fast front-end tooling.
