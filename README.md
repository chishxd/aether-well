## üîÆ About This Project

In a digital world filled with noise, Aether Well offers a pocket of peace. It's a minimalist web application designed to be a quiet space for daily reflection. The concept is simple: you're given a few coins each day. Spending one lets you cast a wish, a hope, or a goal into your own private "well," creating a persistent and beautiful collection of your thoughts.

This project was brought to life in under 48 hours for the **[HackClub Siege](https://siege.hackclub.com/)**, embodying the Week 1 theme: **Coins**.

### ü™ô The Theme: A Mindful Economy

Aether Well is built around a simple but meaningful currency system:

*   **A Daily Ritual:** Users are rewarded with a small number of coins for visiting the app once a day. This encourages a brief, consistent moment of mindfulness without pressure.
*   **An Intentional Act:** Each wish costs one coin. This makes the act of wishing a deliberate choice, giving each hope more weight and value.

## üöÄ Core Features

*   **‚ú® A Daily Moment of Calm:** Receive 5 free coins every 24 hours just for visiting.
*   **üîÆ Cast Your Hopes:** Spend a coin to add a new wish to your personal cosmos.
*   **üåå A Persistent Universe:** Your coin balance and all your wishes are saved directly in your browser's `localStorage`, making your well truly yours.
*   **üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Designed for Serenity:** The entire user interface, from the cosmic background to the glowing "glassmorphism" cards, is crafted to be a beautiful and non-intrusive experience.
